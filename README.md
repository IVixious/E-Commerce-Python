Coffee House Management System ☕🍴 Python Project  
This project is a **Restaurant Management System** designed with clear assumptions and role-based access control.  
It incorporates **modular programming principles** in Python and is built to simplify restaurant operations,  
drawing inspiration from real-world coffee house workflows.  

New users will find it intuitive and easy to use without technical complexity.

## Key Features & Assumptions
In this repo, I have implemented the following core features:

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Three main roles: **Manager, Cashier, and Customer**.  
- Each role is executed separately with dedicated functionalities.  
- Access is strictly limited to role-specific tasks.  

### Real-Time Feedback  
- Customer feedback is collected and updated in real time under the **Manager role**.  

### Cashier Workflow  
- User-friendly interface for inputting customer orders.  
- Menu items are displayed directly, avoiding the need to memorize menu IDs.  
- Products can be filtered by category for easier search.  
- Transactions are simplified through menu IDs for structured organization.  

### Customer Experience  
- Individual accounts with automatic **order ID generation** on checkout.  
- Ability to track order status conveniently.  

### Assumption on System Design  
- System is tailored for a **local coffee house chain**.  
- Inventory and order data flow is tracked for sustainability and cost efficiency.

## Roles & Functionalities  

🔹 **Manager**  
- Monitor real-time customer feedback.  
- Oversee restaurant operations and inventory flow.  
- Access insights on performance and satisfaction.  

🔹 **Cashier**  
- Input and process customer orders easily.  
- Filter and search menu by category.  
- Handle order transactions using menu IDs.  

🔹 **Customer**  
- Register and manage individual account details.  
- Place orders with automatic order ID generation.  
- Track the progress and status of their orders.

## Program Design  
The system is designed with structured modular programming in Python, ensuring clarity and maintainability:  

- **Encapsulation of roles** → Manager, Cashier, and Customer modules are separated.  
- **Automated IDs** → For orders and users, improving tracking accuracy.  
- **Error handling** → Input validation with guidance for incorrect entries.
